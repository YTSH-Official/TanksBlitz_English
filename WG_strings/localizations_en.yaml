The higher the level, the better the tank characteristics and abilities.\n• Ability cooldown resets when the role level increases.\n• Mods have unlimited respawns and change roles after each respawn. The role level does not decrease.\n\n\nImportant details\n\n• Battles are fought in Tier V–X tanks, last 9 minutes, and do not count in statistics."
