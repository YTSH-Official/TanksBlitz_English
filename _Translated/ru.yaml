The goal is to be the last survivor in the battle.\n• During the battle, the play area gradually shrinks.\n• Stay in the safe zone to have a better chance of surviving. If the zone turns yellow, leave it within 60 seconds. After this time, it will turn red and start dealing constant damage to your tank.\n• There are three types of bonuses in the battle that will increase your chances of survival: Supplies, Provisions, and Trophies.\n• Supplies are preset at random points on the map and are marked by a green beam. Capture them to restore tank durability, repair damaged modules, improve crew skills, increase maximum durability, and get extra shells.\n• Provisions are rarer and more valuable bonuses marked by a blue beam. They restore tank durability, repair damaged modules, improve crew skills, recharge equipment, increase maximum durability, and provide extra shells.\n• Trophies are left at the site of destroyed enemies and are marked by a red beam. Pick them up to restore tank durability, reload your gun, increase single-shot damage, increase maximum durability, and get extra shells.\n• Battles take place on tanks of the same level on a special large map, 'Ice Arena'.\n• There is no minimap in the battle.\n• Battles last 8 minutes 30 seconds and are not counted in the statistics."
