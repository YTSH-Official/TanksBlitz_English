The goal is to be the last one standing.\n• During the battle, the game zone gradually shrinks.\n• Stay in the safe zone — this will increase your chances of survival. If the zone turns yellow — leave it within 60 seconds. After this time, it will turn red and start dealing constant damage to your tank.\n• In battle, you can find three types of bonuses that will increase your chances of survival: Supplies, Provisions, and Trophies.\n• Supplies are pre-set at random points on the map and are marked with a green beam. Capture them to restore your tank's HP, repair damaged modules, improve crew mastery, and increase maximum HP.\n• Provisions — a rarer and more valuable bonus, marked with a blue beam. Restores tank HP, repairs damaged modules, improves crew mastery, reloads equipment, and increases maximum HP.\n• Trophies are left at the location of destroyed enemies and are marked with a red beam. Pick them up to restore tank HP, reload the gun, increase single-shot damage, and increase maximum HP.\n• Battles take place in tanks of the same tier on a special large map 'Ice Arena'.\n• There is no minimap in battle.\n• Battles last 8 minutes and 30 seconds and are not counted in statistics."
